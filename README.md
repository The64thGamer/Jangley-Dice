Jangley Dice
-------
This mod adds a dice block to Minecraft. Placing it or clicking it will re-roll it. It can fall like sand, output a redstone signal based on the number on top, and be crafted with minimal materials.

Future plans would be adding different colors, getting the block to re-roll after falling, and having pistons re-roll it after being pushed.

Info
-------
The mod is made with MCreator 2023.4 with the Fabric plugin.
